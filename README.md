# Towards More Fine-grained and Reliable NLP Performance Prediction
This repository provides examples of fine-grained performance prediction for different NLP tasks (machine translation, Part-of-Speech, Named Entity Recognition, and Chinese Word segmentation). We also provide the code we used to perform reliability analysis for performance prediction methods through confidence intervals and calibration.


## Scripts
### Fine-grained Performance Prediction###

```python

compare_models(data_dataframe, data_tensor, missing_values, tensor_mapping, num_folds)

```
